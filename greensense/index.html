        <h1>Welcome to GreenSense!</h1>
        <p>Farming is a tough business. Even small-scale greenhouse farmers, who grow 
        vegetables, herbs, or mushrooms in controlled environments, face many 
        challenges. Crops are sensitive, resources are limited, and profit margins are 
        tight. One mistake—buying too much fertilizer, overwatering, or planting too 
        many crops—can mean wasted time, wasted money, and wasted harvest.<br><br> 
        What if there was a simple way to make smart decisions, reduce waste, and 
        increase profits—without complicated spreadsheets, heavy accounting, or 
        expensive equipment? That’s where GreenSense comes in. </p>

        <h2>What is GreenSense?</h2>
        <p>GreenSense is a smart platform designed to help small greenhouse farmers 
        turn everyday transactions into valuable insights. Every time a farmer buys 
        seeds, fertilizers, or soil, or sells crops to a local market, restaurant, or 
        subscription box, GreenSense collects and analyzes the information.<br><br>
        But it’s not just about recording sales and expenses. GreenSense uses 
        intelligent analysis to answer questions like:<br><br>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li><h3>Which crops are making the most money?</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Where am I spending too much?</h3></li>
        <li><h3>How much should I plant next season?</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Which customers or markets are the most profitable?</h3></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why is GreenSense different?</h2>
        <p>Many tools for farmers are either too complicated or designed for large 
        industrial operations. Spreadsheet tracking is manual and time-consuming. 
        Traditional farm management software is expensive and often too complex for 
        small-scale growers..<br><br>
        GreenSense is different because it is:<br><br>
